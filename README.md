# Clark Dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a dashboard that lets the Clark Summer Research Program track points for
houses, or groups of program participants who receive points for engaging with
the program through events, activites, and good behavior or get deducted points
for doing not-so-good things.

A live deployment can be found at [clark.williecubed.dev](clark.williecubed.dev).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository and installing the rependencies using
`npm install`, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

TODO: Include information on Supabase

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
